## Frame 1 — More Than Messages

- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/01-more-than-messages.html
- duration: 8s
- transition_in: cut
- scene: GC logo resolves from orbiting chat, media, voice, game, and AI signals.
- voiceover: "One group chat. An entire universe inside."
- type: hook
- blueprint: constellation-hub
- asset_candidates: capture/assets/gc-logo.png, capture/assets/group-list-background.png

Start with the outcome, not an inventory: a single place that contains the whole social world.

Adapt: keep the constellation orbit and collapse; replace generic tool icons with GC-native chat, media, voice, game, and AI signals.
Scene 1 (0.0–2.5s): The GC mark appears upper-center over the group-list texture, centered and dominant; chat and media glyphs orbit in layered depth using orbit-3d-entry.
Scene 2 (2.5–5.8s): As “group chat” lands, voice, poll, game, and AI signals add to the ring through center-outward expansion; cyan and amber signals pulse in the top 83%.
Scene 3 (5.8–8.0s): The full constellation collapses cleanly into the mark; lock the thesis under it and hold still with only a subtle glow bloom.

## Selected blueprint: constellation-hub

# constellation-hub — Constellation / Hub + Satellites

**intent**: Labeled/iconned nodes spring into a ring/cluster around a center, then the shot resolves on the core — either by pushing the camera INTO the center (depth-of-field collapsing onto it) or by holding a hub mark while the satellites ORBIT it; the "everything connects to / sits around one center" beat.

**roles served**

- Hook (from `hook-cluster-push-in`): a constellation of tool/app nodes springs into a wide ring, then a sustained camera push-in with depth-of-field resolves on the inner core — "it connects everything / one hub for all your tools."
- Social_Proof (from `social-proof-orbit-ecosystem`): the product brand mark lands as the center hub and partner logos spring onto a ring and revolve around it — "plugs into / sits at the center of your stack."
- CTA (from `cta-orbit-collapse`): the ring resolves by COLLAPSE rather than a push-in — category icons drift around an empty central CTA, a cursor click implodes the orbit toward the click point, and the product demo springs OUT of that collapse as the answer (scope → choice → consequence → product).
- Social_Proof (from `proof-logo-chain`): a persistent center logo accrues proofs — its wordmark decodes, a claim ticker swaps, the logo glides to center, then avatars cascade into orbit with drawn connectors while partner logos scroll the bottom strip; four claims read as one statement.
- Social_Proof (from `scatter-drift-finisher`): the ecosystem beat as a
  static END CARD — a two-line serif `[headline]` is the center (no hub mark, no ring), `[~20 app
icons]` pop in scattered frame-wide in a quick stagger, then keep drifting very slowly OUTWARD
  to the end. "Connects to thousands of apps" said with count and spread, not geometry.

**duration**: 5–8s (Hook 5–6s · Social_Proof 5–8s · CTA orbit-collapse ~6s · Social_Proof
scatter-drift end card ~2.5s as a closing beat)

**shot structure**

Consolidated template — nodes ring a center, then one of two finishers resolves on the core.

- Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s): `[bg]` (dark/space field, optionally slow-drifting diffused gradient blobs). `[primary nodes]` (circles carrying `[icon]` + label) SPRING-POP in (scale 0→1, ~1.15 elastic overshoot, staggered) arranged in a wide ring/cluster around an empty or marked center `[hub]`.
- Scene 2 (~0.7–2.5s, overlapping): smaller `[secondary nodes]` (platform / partner-logo chips) pop in staggered with the same elastic spring, filling the gaps; optional thin `[accent]` connector lines / orbit ring draw from hub→nodes. Camera holds.
- Scene 3 (~2.5–Xs, the resolve): see finisher variant below; lands and HOLDS on the magnified / orbited center to the end.

- Variant — Hook (push-in finisher): from Scene 3, a continuous smooth CAMERA PUSH-IN toward the center inner cluster — inner nodes scale up and stay sharp while outer nodes are pushed toward the edges and progressively BLUR (depth-of-field), background scales up smoothly; holds magnified on the core.
- Variant — Social_Proof (orbit finisher): the center `[brand mark]` snaps in via a quick 3D rotate that decelerates and settles; a thin `[accent]` orbit ring draws around it; `[N partner badges]` spring onto the ring (staggered overshoot) and revolve CLOCKWISE while staying upright, under a continuous slow camera ZOOM-OUT (ecosystem reveal).
- Variant — Social_Proof (optional type-push-through opener, prepended before Scene 1): centered `[headline]` types/slides in with a huge transparent-fill OUTLINE copy of the same words behind it; the outline text scales up exponentially toward camera (high-speed dolly / push-through), breaches the frame, then HARD-CUTS to the hub bg of Scene 1.
- Variant — Social_Proof (scatter-drift finisher, no ring): the center is a two-line serif
  `[headline]` building in place (not a mark); `[~20 app icons]` pop in SCATTERED across the whole
  frame in a quick stagger — no ring geometry, no connectors — then sustain a very slow outward
  drift to the end. Camera fully static: no push-in, no zoom-out; the "everything around one
  center" reads from the drift vectors pointing away from the headline. Often chained as the end
  card of a preceding UI beat (the prior card dissolves into it).

**motion vocabulary**: staggered elastic spring-pop node entrances (~1.15 overshoot); slow gradient-blob drift; connector-line / orbit-ring draw-on; 3D snap-rotate-settle on the hub mark; continuous camera push-in (inner sharp, outer depth-of-field blur, bg scale-up); clockwise orbital revolve of upright badges; continuous slow camera zoom-out (ecosystem reveal); optional outline-text push-through dolly entry. Scatter-drift finisher: frame-wide scattered icon pop-in (staggered, no ring); sustained slow
outward icon drift; in-place two-line serif headline build; static-frame hold to the end.

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rules/<id>.md`)

- staggered spring-pop node entrances → `spring-pop-entrance` (elastic overshoot) + `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe); 3D-flip-in flavor → `orbit-3d-entry`
- ring / cluster layout of nodes around a center → `avatar-cloud-network` (nodes on an elliptical ring + SVG lines to a center)
- icons on the nodes → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- connector lines hub→node → `svg-path-draw`
- orbit-ring draw-on → `svg-path-draw`
- slow gradient-blob drift → `sine-wave-loop` (idle looped drift)
- 3D snap-rotate-settle on hub mark → `orbit-3d-entry` (3D-flip entry); technique CSS-3D
- clockwise orbital revolve of upright badges → `orbit-3d-entry` (continuous elliptical orbit); technique MotionPath
- camera push-in toward center → `multi-phase-camera` (PUSH-in) + `coordinate-target-zoom` (target the core)
- background scale-up during push-in → `multi-phase-camera`
- continuous slow zoom-out (ecosystem reveal) → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back) / `coordinate-target-zoom`
- outline-text push-through dolly opener (Social_Proof) → `3d-text-depth-layers` (outline copy behind) + `multi-phase-camera` (push-through)
- depth-of-field blur on outer nodes during push-in → `depth-of-field-blur` (progressive DOF/focus-falloff blur on the off-center outer nodes while the inner core stays sharp)
- frame-wide scattered icon pop-in (no ring) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group) +
  `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe); positions pre-baked scattered — NOT `avatar-cloud-network`'s
  elliptical ring
- sustained slow outward icon drift → `center-outward-expansion` (outward vectors, slow sustained
  register — drift targets sit slightly past the pop-in positions)
- in-place serif headline build → `gsap-effects` (staggered line/word reveal)

**camera modifier**: push-in-with-DOF (Hook) — `multi-phase-camera` PUSH-in targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` onto the core; the focus-falloff blur half of it is backed by `depth-of-field-blur`. Orbit finisher (Social_Proof) — slow continuous zoom-out via `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back) while satellites revolve. Scatter-drift finisher (Social_Proof end card) — none: the frame never moves; the outward drift
is element-level.

# Orbit with 3D Entry

Elements flip in from 3D space (`rotateX` + `rotateY` + negative `z`) then settle into a continuous elliptical orbit around a center label. Distinct from one-shot reveals — the orbit keeps running, driven by a 0→1 progress tween INSIDE the timeline (never rAF).

## How It Works

Per element, two phases: (1) a `back.out` flip from a hidden 3D orientation to flat — **in place at its orbital starting position** (see Critical Constraints); (2) a continuous orbit where `onUpdate` computes `x/y` from `cos/sin(initialAngle + p·2π)` on the ellipse. The stage needs `perspective` on the scene root and `preserve-3d` on stage + items, or the flip flattens to a 2D scale.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="orbit-stage">
  <div class="orbit-item" data-angle="0">{glyph1}</div>
  <div class="orbit-item" data-angle="60">{glyph2}</div>
  <!-- … evenly-spaced angles … -->
  <div class="orbit-center">{centerLabel}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene-root {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  perspective: 1800px; /* REQUIRED */
}
.orbit-stage {
  position: relative;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}
.orbit-item {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  will-change: transform;
}
.orbit-center {
  position: relative;
  transform: translateZ(220px); /* wins paint order inside preserve-3d */
  z-index: 9999;
}
```

```js
const items = document.querySelectorAll(".orbit-item");
const RADIUS_Y = RADIUS_X * Y_TO_X_RATIO; // perspective-flattened ellipse

items.forEach((el, i) => {
  const a0 = (Number(el.dataset.angle) / 360) * Math.PI * 2;
  const startX = Math.cos(a0) * RADIUS_X;
  const startY = Math.sin(a0) * RADIUS_Y;

  // 1) Park at the orbital position, hidden — BEFORE any tween fires
  gsap.set(el, {
    xPercent: -50,
    yPercent: -50,
    x: startX,
    y: startY,
    rotateX: ROTATE_X_FROM,
    rotateY: ROTATE_Y_FROM,
    z: Z_FROM,
    opacity: 0,
    scale: SCALE_FROM,
  });

  // 2) Flip in IN PLACE — rotation/opacity/scale only, never translate
  tl.to(
    el,
    {
      rotateX: 0,
      rotateY: 0,
      z: 0,
      opacity: 1,
      scale: 1,
      duration: ENTRY_DUR,
      ease: `back.out(${FLIP_BACK})`,
    },
    i * STAGGER,
  );

  // 3) Continuous orbit — each item gets its OWN progress tween (own initialAngle)
  const orbit = { p: 0 };
  tl.to(
    orbit,
    {
      p: 1,
      duration: ORBIT_DURATION,
      ease: "none",
      onUpdate: () => {
        const a = a0 + orbit.p * Math.PI * 2;
        const x = Math.cos(a) * RADIUS_X;
        const y = Math.sin(a) * RADIUS_Y;
        // capped z-index band [1, 50] — see center-label clearance below
        el.style.zIndex = String(1 + Math.round(((y + RADIUS_Y) / (2 * RADIUS_Y)) * 49));
        el.style.transform = `translate(-50%, -50%) translate(${x}px, ${y}px)`;
      },
    },
    i * STAGGER + ENTRY_DUR,
  );
});

tl.from(
  ".orbit-center",
  { opacity: 0, scale: 0.6, duration: ENTRY_DUR, ease: `back.out(${CENTER_BACK})` },
  CENTER_FADE_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Collapse to center**: a final 1→0 driver multiplies both radii (and item scale) in `onUpdate` — the ring condenses into the center element; pairs with a CTA "click" igniting the collapse.
- **Tilted orbit plane**: `rotateX(25deg)` on `.orbit-stage` — items visibly arc through the plane.

## Critical Constraints

- **❗ Entry must flip IN PLACE at the orbital position, NOT at center** — `gsap.set` each item at `(cos(a0)·RADIUS_X, sin(a0)·RADIUS_Y)` with `opacity: 0` BEFORE adding tweens, then phase 1 animates only rotation/opacity/scale. A fromTo that keeps `x/y: 0` flips at the stage center, collides with the center label, then teleports to the orbit when phase 2 starts.
- **❗ Center-label clearance** — `z-index` alone is unreliable inside `preserve-3d` (paint order follows actual Z): push the label forward with `translateZ(220px)` + `z-index: 9999`, cap item z-index to `[1, 50]`, AND size the ring so items clear the label horizontally at every angle: `RADIUS_X × min|cos(θ)| ≥ L_w + I_w + breathing_room` (label/item half-widths; for 6 items the worst case is `cos(30°) ≈ 0.866`). A heavier wordmark needs a wider ring.
- **Each item gets its OWN orbit tween** — a shared `targets: ".orbit-item"` tween can't carry per-item `initialAngle`.
- **The center element is the headline** — the orbit is ornament; if it dominates, grow the center or fade the items down.
